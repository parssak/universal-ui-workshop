# Universal UI Workshop

This is a work in progress. Aiming to build a totally customizable UI library using TailwindCSS 3.2

This is where I experiment with ideas before incorporating into the actual library, which is at https://github.com/parssak/universal-ui

This repo will be archived in the forseeable future.
